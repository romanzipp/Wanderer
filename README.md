## Usage

![](art/diagram.png)

As shown in the diagram above, Wanderer acts as a deployment manager between your CI/CD pipeline and your Nomad cluster. 
The build pipeline will instruct Wanderer to deploy a new version of a job, after which the predefined job template will be injected with the currently tagged version.
Wanderer also supports multiple versions in one template, for example a web project with an API backend `BACKEND_VERSION` and a frontend `FRONTEND_VERSION`.

### Nomad Job Templates

The predefined [Nomad HCL templates](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/job-specification) need to contain **version selectors** in the following syntax: `{{ VERSION_NAME }}`

#### Example Job

The following job defined a `BACKEND_VERSION` which will be replaced by the actual version during deployment by Wanderer.

```hcl
job "my-service" {
  type = "service"

  group "backend" {
    task "app" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        image = "my-service:{{ BACKEND_VERSION }}"
      }
    }
  } 
}
```

You can also define the version selectors in the [`meta` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/job-specification/meta) for more structure.

```hcl
job "my-service" {
  type = "service"
  meta {
    version_backend = "{{ BACKEND_VERSION }}"
    version_frontend = "{{ FRONTEND_VERSION }}"
  }

  group "backend" {
    task "app" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        image = "my-service/backend:{{ env "NOMAD_META_version_backend" }}"
      }
    }
  }

  group "frontend" {
    task "app" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
        image = "my-service/frontend:{{ env "NOMAD_META_version_frontend" }}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Deploy Wanderer via Docker

```
docker pull ghcr.io/romanzipp/wanderer:latest
```

See [repository](https://github.com/romanzipp/Wanderer/pkgs/container/wanderer) for more information.

### Local

#### Build

```shell
docker build -t wanderer:latest .
```

#### Run

```shell
docker run \
  -v "$(pwd)/data/:/app/data/" \
  -v "$(pwd)/.env:/app/.env" \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  wanderer:latest
```

### On Nomad via Docker

You can also just deploy Wanderer via Nomad itself.

```hcl
job "wanderer" {
  type = "service"
  
  group "wanderer" {
    network {
      mode = "bridge"

      port "http" {
        to = 8080
      }
    }

    service {
      name = "wanderer"
      port = "http"
    }

    task "wanderer" {
      driver = "docker"

      config {
        image   = "ghcr.io/romanzipp/wanderer:1.3.0"
        ports   = ["http"]
        volumes = [
          "local/.env:/app/.env"
        ]

        mount {
          type     = "bind"
          target   = "/app/data/"
          source   = "/opt/wanderer/data/"
          readonly = false
          bind_options {
            propagation = "rshared"
          }
        }
      }

      template {
        destination = "local/.env"
        change_mode = "restart"
        data        = <<-EOH
        APP_PASSWORD=supersecret
        SESSION_LIFETIME=43200
        EOH
      }

    }
  }
}

```
